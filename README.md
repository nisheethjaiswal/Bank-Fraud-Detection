Bank Fraud Detection

Machine Learning project on imbalanced data classification for classifying bank frauds and build a best suitable model with an accuracy score of 0.9966 Worked on different classification techniques by applying oversampling using SMOTE and finding the area under the ROC-AUC.

Techniques and Algorithms used:

- SMOTE: Oversampling for Imbalanced data
- K-fold Cross Validation
- Logistic Regression Classifier
- K Neighbours Classifier
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Light GBM Classifier
- Catboost Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

The results from all the above differnt classifiers were compared to finally decide upon the best algorithm for the Fraud detection analysis on a very highly imbalanced transactions dataset.
